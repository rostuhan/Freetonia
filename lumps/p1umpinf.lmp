survivors flee the ship. The launch process
is irreversible: killing you now would only
bring a slow death drifting through space.
 
Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight. Fifty-seven. .  .
You melt into the pilot's seat, lost in the
voice of an automated assembly of angels
delivering you from this wretched rock.
 
The ship rumbles as she wakes up;
you think of Earth as she lifts off.
Hopefully AGM won't find you there:
they've got the outbreak to deal with,
so that'll give you some time.
 
Destination: Earth!"
